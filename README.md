Repository holding the code for the NNFwP series of blog articles available [here](https://mathspp.com/blog/tag:nnfwp).

To make sure you have all dependencies installed (which should be only NumPy, really)
be sure to check you meet the requirements set in the [requirements file](./requirements.txt).
The simplest way to go about doing so would be by running the command

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
